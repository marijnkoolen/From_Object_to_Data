From Object to Data
==============

Course description From Object to Data

## Learning Objectives

- insight in how a shift in perspective on humanities material from objects as objects to objects as data points has an impact on humanities research.
- insight in the relevance of data-oriented research for humanities disciplines.
- knowledge of digital and programmatic concepts for working with humanities data.
- skills in structuring digital research around a research question in the form of a recipe.

## Summary

All humanities disciplines are confronted with more and more digital material. 
This digital material can be studied as individual objects or descriptions of events, but from a digital perspecitive they can also be considered as data points. Digital methods allow researchers to study relations between objects form a different perspective and on a larger scale. 

How can humanities researchers use digital data to support their research? What digital tools are at their disposal and how can these tools provide new perspectives and research questions? Following the Coding the Humanities course, this course looks at digital data sources and tools that are relevant to the humanities from a programmatic perspective. ...

## Weekly Overview

### Week 1: Objects as Data Points

Overview:
- the shifting perspective on humanities material from objects as objects to objects as data points. 
- Using data to construct narratives.
- research workflow: data-oriented research as a research recipe in 7 steps.

Concepts: 
- data-oriented research
- hypothesis
- types of data (text, sound, video and images as data, metadata)
- static, streaming and real-time data

### Week 2: Acquiring data

Overview:
- Availability and relevance of data sources
- Obtaining data from sources: data dumps, API's, queries
- Evaluating data: appropriateness and representativeness

Concepts:
- data objects
- data formats
- data dumps, APIs, queries, iteration
- selecting and sampling

### Week 3: Handling Metadata

Overview:
- Humanities material and metadata
- Metadata: consistency, completeness and subjectivity
- Parsing: identifying individual units of data, adding meaning to data
- Filtering: removing irrelevant data, 

Concepts: 
- data storage
- data formats: JSON, XML
- segmentation, identification
- getting data in a manageable, comprehensible form
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 4: Handling Raw Data

Complex data objects like texts, musical scores and images can be segmented into units in many different ways. But what are the relevant units for your analysis? For instance, what are the relevant units for analysing a painting? What aspects of images can be identified and segmented into individual units of data? Can we identify objects? Individual brush strokes? 

- Parsing and filtering texts and images
- Regular expressions for text analysis
- Concepts: data units, segmenting `unstructured' data
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 5: Exploring Metadata

- Steps 4, 5 & 6: mining, representing, refining
- Once the data is in manageable form, we can start exploring
- Hunting for stories, bring out meaningful information 
- Concepts: data facets, summarising, aggregating, 
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 6: Exploring Raw Data

How do you choose a visual model that allows you to explore your data and discover areas of interest? How do you choose a representative visual model that supports the story that you want to tell?

- Steps 4, 5 & 6: mining, representing, refining
- Concepts: clustering, sorting, ordering, visual models, patterns, trees, networks
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 7: Interacting with Data

- Step 7: interacting with data, as a researcher and as a user.
- How can interacting with data bring out the story that you want to tell?
- Concepts: ...
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 8: Presenting Data

- Concepts:



### To Do

- Example projects
- Example research questions
- Interesting Humanities problems related to each step
- between prefabricated tools and programmatic approaches
